# AI-Based-Code-Debugger-Project-

An AI-based code debugger is a cutting-edge tool designed to streamline and enhance the process of identifying, analyzing, and fixing bugs in software code. By leveraging machine learning and natural language processing, these debuggers provide developers with smarter diagnostics, automated suggestions, and predictive insights—transforming how modern software is built and maintained.

🔍 Core Capabilities

Intelligent Bug Detection: Uses pattern recognition to flag common coding mistakes and subtle logic errors.

Contextual Suggestions: Offers targeted fixes based on code context, past corrections, and best practices.

Automated Root Cause Analysis: Traces errors to their origin using code flow understanding and historical data.

Natural Language Interaction: Allows developers to query the debugger using plain English—“Why is this returning null?”—and receive meaningful responses.

Code Optimization: Proposes performance improvements alongside bug fixes for cleaner, more efficient code.
